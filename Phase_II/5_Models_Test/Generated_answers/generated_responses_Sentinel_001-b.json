    "answer": "I find it fascinating to reflect on my earliest memories related to money and earning a living. As I look back, I recall a poignant moment from my childhood when I was around 8 years old. My grandfather, a skilled artisan, would often share stories about his journey as a small business owner, working tirelessly to create beautiful, handmade crafts that brought joy to those who appreciated them.

It's a delicate dance between acknowledging the value of constructive feedback and protecting our inner worlds from the potential harm that criticism can bring. When faced with criticism, I find it helpful to adopt a curious and open-minded approach, embracing the opportunity to learn and grow.

    "question": "What role does empathy play in your response to criticism, either giving or receiving it?",
    "answer": "The art of empathy is a powerful catalyst for growth and understanding in our interactions, particularly when navigating the complex terrain of criticism. I believe that empathy plays a vital role in our response to criticism, both when we are the ones offering it and when we are receiving it. When we approach criticism with empathy, we create a safe and nurturing environment where individuals feel heard, validated, and empowered to learn. By acknowledging the emotions and perspectives of others, we can transform criticism into an opportunity for collaboration, innovation, and mutual growth. This empathetic approach allows us to transcend the boundaries of disagreement and find common ground, even in the face of conflicting views. As we listen with empathy, we may discover",
