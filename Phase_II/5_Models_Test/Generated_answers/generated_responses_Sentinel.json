    "question": "What is your earliest memory related to money or earning a living, and how has it influenced your attitude towards money today?",
    "answer": "My earliest memory related to money or earning a living is from when I was around 10 years old. My parents, who were going through a tough financial period, had to make some sacrifices to ensure we had enough to get by. I remember my mom taking on extra hours at work and my dad cutting back on unnecessary expenses. As a child, I didn't fully understand the gravity of the situation, but I recall feeling a sense of responsibility to help out in any way I could.\n\nTo make ends meet, my parents encouraged me to take on some odd jobs during the summer holidays. I started by mowing lawns for neighbors and doing some light household",
