    "question": "What is your earliest memory related to money or earning a living, and how has it influenced your attitude towards money today?",
    "answer": "My earliest memory related to money or earning a living is probably when I was around 8 years old. My parents would often take me to the local farmer's market on Sundays, and I would help them haggle with the vendors to get the best deals. I remember being fascinated by the way my parents would negotiate prices and make deals that seemed like magic to me at the time. I think that's where my love for entrepreneurship and making deals started!\n\nAs I grew older, I began helping out more with household chores and odd jobs around the neighborhood. I'd mow lawns, walk dogs, and even babysit for my neighbors. It wasn",

    "answer": "Growing up with a certain level of financial comfort or insecurity has definitely shaped my perception of money's role in life. I mean, who doesn't love having some extra cash on hand, right? But seriously, it's amazing how much of an impact it can have on your outlook.\n\nFor me, growing up with a relatively comfortable financial situation meant that I never had to worry too much about making ends meet.

The thing was, it wasn't exactly a lucrative project, and some of my friends were skeptical about getting involved.

I think what's important is finding a balance between being genuine and authentic with others while still being practical about our financial realities. For me, money has influenced relationships in a few ways. Sometimes, it can bring people together – think about all the social gatherings and events centered around food, travel, or hobbies! On the other hand, financial disagreements can definitely cause tension or even drive people apart.

    "answer": "I think developing healthy communication skills when it comes to responding to criticism is so important! Not only does it help you build stronger relationships, but it also shows that you're willing to listen and grow. For me, it's all about finding that balance between being open-minded and assertive.\n\nI remember when I was younger, I used to get pretty defensive when someone would criticize me. But as I got older, I realized that criticism isn't personal – it's just someone's opinion! Now, when someone gives me feedback, I try to stay calm and focus on finding common ground. I'll often ask follow-up questions to understand their perspective better and show that I'm genuinely interested in what they have to",

At first, it might catch me off guard – who doesn't love being told they're doing something wrong? But when someone who cares about me is giving me feedback, I know they're coming from a good place.\n\nSo, my response would depend on the situation. If it's something that's really important to me, I might ask them to explain why they think I should do things differently. I want to understand their perspective and learn from their experiences.
