    "question": "What is your earliest memory related to money or earning a living, and how has it influenced your attitude towards money today?",
    "answer": "My earliest memory related to money is of my grandfather, a kind and gentle man who worked tirelessly as a carpenter to provide for our family. I must have been around 5 or 6 years old when I recall accompanying him to his small workshop, watching him carefully measure and cut wood, and marveling at the way his hands moved with precision and skill. He would often take a break to share a snack with me, and I loved the way he would pull out a few coins from his pocket and let me count them, teaching me about the value of hard work and the importance of saving.\n\nAs I grew older, I began to understand the sacrifices",

I wanted to pursue my passion for sustainability and environmental impact, and I believed that starting my own business would allow me to make a greater difference.\n\nThe risk was significant. I had to quit my steady income, take on a massive amount of debt to fund the venture, and put my personal savings at risk. I was 35 years old",

It was a few years ago, when I was in my early twenties, struggling to make ends meet as a freelance writer. I was working multiple projects, yet barely scraping by, living paycheck to paycheck. I remember feeling like I was stuck in a rut, wondering if I was cut out for this whole \"adulting\" thing.\n\nOne day, I stumbled upon an article about a successful entrepreneur who had built a lucrative business from scratch. What struck me was not just the magnitude of their success, but the way they had prioritized their values and passions along the way",

For me, it's often a complex cocktail of feelings that can be hard to untangle.\n\nInitially, I'd say the first emotion that tends to surface is defensiveness. My mind starts racing, and I might feel like I need to justify or explain myself, almost like I'm on the spot to prove my point. It's like my brain is shouting, \"Hey, wait a minute, I know what I'm talking about! I'm right, and you're wrong!\" This defensiveness can be overwhelming, and it's not always easy to acknowledge, let alone address.\n\nBut as the initial",
